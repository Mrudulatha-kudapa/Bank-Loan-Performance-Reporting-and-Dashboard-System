# SQL-Bank.Loan
The Bank Loan Performance Reporting and Dashboard System was developed using SQL to automate and streamline the monitoring of loan metrics, enabling real-time insights and supporting data-driven decision-making. This system utilizes SQL queries to dynamically track and visualize key performance indicators such as loan applications, funded amounts, repayment status, and loan delinquency rates. By centralizing and automating data retrieval, the project enhances loan management efficiency, enables rapid identification of trends, and provides stakeholders with timely, actionable information to improve operational oversight and optimize loan portfolio strategies..
